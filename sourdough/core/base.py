    """Base class for all pieces of sourdough composite objects.
    
    A Component differs from an Element in 3 significant ways:
        1) It includes a 'contents' attribute which can store any type of
            object as part of a larger composite structure. In this way, 
            Component acts as a wrapper for pieces in a composite whole.
        2) It includes a 'library' registry that stores all subclasses. This
            makes it easy to access any imported Component subclass using a
            string key.
        3) It has several private class methods which allow access to 'library' 
            using other techniques other than the associated string key.
    
    Args:
        contents (Any): a stored object.
        name (str): property which designates the internal reference of a class 
            instance that is used throughout sourdough. For example, if a 
            sourdough instance needs options from a Settings instance, 'name' 
            should match the appropriate section name in the Settings instance. 
            Defaults to None. If 'name' is None, it will be assigned to the 
            snake case version of the class name ('__name__' or 
            '__class__.__name__').
        library (ClassVar[Mapping[str, Callable]): stores subclasses. The keys
