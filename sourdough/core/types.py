Unless otherwise noted, all sourdough types are compatible with sourdough 
quirks. Following normal python multiple inheritance rules, quirks should be 
listed before any base sourdough class. I have attempted to design sourdough
to allow for any order of inherited types and quirks. But I cannot guarantee
that the classes will work as intended if the python ordering rules are not
followed.

All sourdough types have a 'contents' attribute where an item or 'items' are
internally stored. This is used instead of the normal 'data' attribute use in
base python classes to make it easier for users to know which object they are
accessing when using either 'contents' or 'data'.

Contents:
    Proxy (collections.abc.Container): basic wrapper for a stored static or
        iterable item. Dunder methods attempt to intelligently apply access
        methods to either the wrapper or the wrapped item.
    Bunch (Iterable, ABC): abstract base class for sourdough iterables. All 
        subclasses must have an 'add' method as well as store their contents in 
        the 'contents' attribute.
    Progression (MutableSequence, Bunch): sourdough drop-in replacement for 
        list with additional functionality.
    Hybrid (Progression): iterable with both dict and list interfaces and 
        methods that stores items with a 'name' attribute.
    Lexicon (MutableMapping, Bunch): sourdough's drop-in replacement for 
        python dicts with some added functionality.
    Catalog (Lexicon): wildcard-accepting dict which is primarily intended for 
        storing different options and strategies. It also returns lists of 
        matches if a list of keys is provided.

class Proxy(collections.abc.Container):
    """Container for holding single items.
    
    A Proxy differs than an ordinary container in 2 significant ways:
        1) When an 'in' call is made, the '__contains__' method first looks to
            see if the item is stored in 'contents' (if 'contents' is a 
            collection). If that check gets a TypeError, the method then checks
            if the item is equivalent to 'contents'. This allows a Proxy to be
            agnostic as to the type of item(s) in 'contents' while returning the
            expected result from an 'in' call.
        2) Access methods for getting, setting, and deleting try to 
            intelligently direct the user's call to the proxy or stored class.
            So, for example, when a user tries to set an attribute on the proxy,
            the method will replace an attribute that exists in the proxy if
            one exists. But if there is no such attribute, the set method is
            applied to 'contents'.

    Args:
        contents (Any): any stored item(s). Defaults to None.

            methods for adding to a python iterable ('append', 'extend', 
            'update', etc.) remain, but 'add' allows a subclass to designate the
            preferred method of adding to the iterable's stored data.
        2) It allows the '+' operator to be used to join a Bunch subclass 
            instance of the same general type (Mapping, Sequence, Tuple, etc.). 
            The '+' operator calls the Bunch subclass 'add' method to implement 
            how the added item(s) is/are added to the Bunch subclass instance.

class Hybrid(Progression):
    """Base class for ordered iterables in sourdough composite objects.
    
    Hybrid combines the functionality and interfaces of python dicts and lists.
    It allows duplicate keys and list-like iteration while supporting the easier
    access methods of dictionaries. In order to support this hybrid approach to
    iterables, Hybrid can only store items with a 'name' attribute or property.
    
    Hybrid is the primary iterable base class used in sourdough composite 
    objects.
    
    A Hybrid inherits the differences between a Progression and an ordinary 
    python list.
    
    A Hybrid differs from a Progression in 3 significant ways:
        1) It only store items with 'name' attributes or properties.
        2) Hybrid has an interface of both a dict and a list, but stores a list. 
            Hybrid does this by taking advantage of the 'name' attribute of 
            stored items. A 'name' acts as a key to create the facade of a dict
            with the items in the stored list serving as values. This allows for 
            duplicate keys for storing class instances, easier iteration, and 
            returning multiple matching items. This design comes at the expense 
            of lookup speed. As a result, Hybrid should only be used if a high 
            volume of access calls is not anticipated. Ordinarily, the loss of 
            lookup speed should have negligible effect on overall performance.
        3) It includes "excludify" and "subsetify" methods which return new
            instances with a subset of 'contents' based upon the 'subset'
            argument passed to the method. 'excludify' returns all 'contents'
            that do not have names matching items in the 'subset' argument.
            'subsetify' returns all 'contents' that have names matching items
            in the 'subset' argument.

    Args:
        contents (Sequence[Any]): items with 'name' attributes to store. If a

class Catalog(Lexicon):
    """Base class for a wildcard and list-accepting dictionary.

    A Catalog inherits the differences between a Lexicon and an ordinary python
    dict.

    A Catalog differs from a Lexicon in 6 significant ways:
        1) It recognizes an 'all' key which will return a list of all values
            stored in a Catalog instance.
        2) It recognizes a 'default' key which will return all values matching
            keys listed in the 'defaults' attribute. 'default' can also be set
            using the 'catalog['default'] = new_default' assignment. If 
            'defaults' is not passed when the instance is initialized, the 
            initial value of 'defaults' is 'all'.
        3) It recognizes a 'none' key which will return an empty list.
        4) It supports a list of keys being accessed with the matching values 
            returned. For example, 'catalog[['first_key', 'second_key']]' will 
            return the values for those keys in a list ['first_value',
            'second_value'].
        5) If a single key is sought, a Catalog can either return the stored
            value or a stored value in a list (if 'always_return_list' is
            True). The latter option is available to make iteration easier
            when the iterator assumes a single datatype will be returned.
        6) It includes a 'instance' and 'select' methods which return instances 
            or stored classes, respectively.

            passed is not a list or special access key (True) or to return a
