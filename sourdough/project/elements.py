    The 'contents' and 'parameters' attributes are combined at the last moment
    to allow for runtime alterations.
    
    Args:
        contents (object): core object used by the 'perform' method. Defaults 
            to None.
        parameters (Mapping[Any, Any]]): parameters to be attached to
            'contents' when the 'perform' method is called. Defaults to an 
            empty dict.
        modules Union[str, Sequence[str]]: name(s) of module(s) where the 
            contents to load is/are located. Defaults to an empty list.
        name (str): designates the name of a class instance that is used for 
            internal referencing throughout sourdough. For example if a 
            sourdough instance needs settings from a Settings instance, 'name' 
            should match the appropriate section name in the Settings instance.

            attribute as the base class for effective coordination between

            '__post_init__' of Component is called, 'name' is set based upon
            the 'get_name' method in Component. If that method is not

        _loaded (ClassVar[Mapping[Any, Any]]): dict of str keys and previously
            loaded objects. This is checked first by the 'load' method to avoid
            unnecessary re-importation. Defaults to an empty dict.
